# Description

This image is used to configure the Kong API gateway service in a automated, declarative and version controlled
way. It uses [gongfig](https://github.com/romanovskyj/gongfig) to accomplish this, due to the fact that Kong does not
offer this capability by itself at the moment. However, this may change, see this
[RFC: Kong native Declarative Config format](https://discuss.konghq.com/t/rfc-kong-native-declarative-config-format/2719/2).
